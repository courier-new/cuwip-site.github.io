			<h1>How to Apply</h1>
			<p>
				We are delighted that you are interested in joining us at CUWiP! During the application period (September 1st to October 13th), you must apply directly through the <a href='https://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwipapp.cfm'>APS CUWiP application site</a>. There is no cost to apply to CUWiP.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I apply?</h3>
			<p>
				Bear in mind that the Western Regional conference is intended to serve applicants from <strong>California</strong> (south of San Jose), <strong>Alaska</strong>, and <strong>Hawaii</strong>. Students from other locations are encouraged to <a href='http://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm#map'>check the map</a> and apply to the conference site geographically closest to them. While the conference targets undergraduate women and underrepresented genders passionate about physics and astronomy, anyone seriously interested in attending may apply. For other questions about applicant eligibility, visit our <a href='../faq'>FAQ</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Will I be admitted?</h3>
			<p>
				We anticipate that CUWiP@HMC+POM+CPP will be oversubscribed. Therefore, it is crucial to complete all parts of the application and to write a thoughtful Applicant Statement that conveys how this conference is meaningful for your personal and professional growth. In the event that the conference is oversubscribed, priority will be given to applicants who are:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Undergraduate physics majors</li>
				<li>Community college students planning to transfer to a physics program at a four year institution</li>
				<li>New to conferences, and specifically APS CUWiP</li>
				<li>Applying to the conference that is geographically closest to their expected location January 12th to 14th</li>
			</ul>
