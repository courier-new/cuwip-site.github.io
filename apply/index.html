			</p>
			<h3>Can I apply?</h3>

Students from other locations are encouraged to check the map below and apply to the conference site geographically closest to them.

			<h3>What will it cost?</h3>
			<p>
				There is no cost to apply to CUWiP. If you are admitted, there is a one-time registration fee of $45. While you are expected to make your own <a href='../travel'>travel arrangements</a>, lodging, food, and transportation to conference events will be provided to all participants at no cost. Visit our <a href='../faq#costandfunding'>FAQ</a> for more information about costs and funding.

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Are undergraduate physics, astronomy, or engineering physics majors</li>
					<li>Are community college students planning to transfer to a physics program at a four year institution</li>
					<li>Have never attended APS CUWiP</li>
