			<h1>Submitting your Abstract</h1>
			<p>
				If you are interested in presenting a research poster at the conference, you can submit a poster title and abstract when registering to attend CUWiP at Harvey Mudd, Pomona, and Cal Poly Pomona. Registration opens after you have been notified of your application status on November 6th.
			</p>
			<p>
				Research abstracts are used throughout the scientific community to provide a concise summary of a research project. Typically, research abstracts will include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction to the field or topic</li>
				<li>Motivation or problem statement</li>
				<li>Summary of procedure, approach, instruments used, etc.</li>
				<li>Results and their implications</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You will have up to 250 words for your abstract. Fitting all of this into such a restrictive word count can be a difficult, daunting task. A good tip is to start writing the abstract without worrying too much about the word limit, making sure that you include any relevant information. If this produces something longer than 250 words, try to revisit it in a day or two with fresh eyes, and you will likely find that some of the information is irrelevant or overcomplicated and can be cut. Of course, on the other hand, if your abstract is excessively short, you could probably afford to add more information.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is an abundance of useful information on writing abstracts available online. It may also help to consult your research advisor or ask for feedback from students who were not a part of the research project. You may also view some of last year's submissions from <a href='http://mms.rice.edu/cuwip.rice.edu/cuwip_poster_session.html'>Rice University</a> as examples.
			</p>
			<h1>Presenting your Poster</h1>
			<p>
				We will release a schedule and directions for setting up your poster once the conference date gets closer. <strong>Posters must be electronically generated and printed before arriving for CUWiP.</strong>
			</p>
			<h3>Printing Size</h3>
			<p>
				To ensure your poster fits on our boards, <!--TODO-->guidelines for poster size. Your poster should include the names of you, your institution, and any research advisors, collaborators, or contributors.
			</p>
			<h3>Writing for Your Poster</h3>
			<p>
				Your language should be clear and avoid unnecessary jargon you would not encounter in your standard physics classes. Remember that your audience is fellow undergraduate physics majors who are not specialists in your field. Limit the amount of text you include -- well thought out pictures, drawings, charts, figures, etc. can convey more. The content of your poster should be easy to follow in the absence of a presenter, so save the detailed explanations for your verbal interactions during the poster session.
			</p>
			<h3>Design Tips</h3>
			<p>
				Text and figures on your poster should be legible from a distance of 4 to 6 feet. With that in mind, you should generally not use anything less than 18-point font. Also watch out for the resolution of your images.  Graphs that look fine on a computer screen often turn out fuzzy in print -- images generated with at least 200 dpi will generally be sharp enough (screen grabs and jpegs are usually only 72 dpi).
			</p>
			<p>
				Try to arrange elements of your poster logically by visually drawing attention both to the problem your research addresses and to your conclusions. That being said, simple, elegant design schemes will also increase the overall readability and impact of your poster. You should avoid using more than two fonts: one for titles/section headers and one for paragraphs/data. You should also stick to more than one but fewer than three colors. Make sure your graphs in particular do not involve too many colors or become otherwise overcomplicated. An example poster layout is given below:
