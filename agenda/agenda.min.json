Driving tractors on a farm in Hawaii where she grew up somehow led to science and engineering pursuits. Nicknamed 'happy pants' in college, Dianna researched dark matter with Prof. Jocelyn Monroe as an undergraduate at MIT, and low-metallicity stars with Prof. Anna Frebel as a post-baccalaureate research fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, before bringing her happy intern pants to GE where she worked as a Software Engineer designing mobile apps. Eventually, she started exercising the nerdy side of her brain on YouTube as Physics Girl before (and while) heading over to UCSD as a science outreach coordinator.

This territory includes metrological instruments whose precision is limited by the quantum projection noise of millions of atoms; and materials whose bulk properties emerge from many-body interactions intractable to simulation on classical computers.

Her research focuses on studies of the Universe at both the smallest and the largest scales, to probe two questions: What is the Universe made of? What are the laws of physics that govern the constituents of the Universe? She has held a number of leadership positions in experiments at accelerators that probe the elementary particles and the fundamental interactions. She is now part of a large international team of scientists preparing for analysis of data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will provide the most extensive census of the Universe to date. She and her collaborators will use these data to investigate the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the cosmological evolution of the Universe.</p> <p>Patricia Burchat is a “first-gen” high school graduate. She received her Bachelors degree in Engineering Science at University of Toronto in 1981, and her PhD in Physics from Stanford in 1986. She was a postdoc and faculty member at UC Santa Cruz before returning to Stanford as a faculty member in 1995. At Stanford, she has served as Chair of the Physics Department and has been very active in introducing research-based pedagogy in the teaching of physics. She has received the Dean’s Award for Distinguished Teaching and the Walter J. Gores Award for excellence in teaching, and was elected as Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society. Patricia Burchat has played a leading role in the growth of the APS Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics.</p>"},{"name":"Lunch","sname":"lunch","types":["food"],"timeStart":"12:30 PM","timeEnd":"2:15 PM","required":true,"place":"Millikan Courtyard","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Poster Session","sname":"posters","types":["misc"],"timeStart":"12:30 PM","timeEnd":"2:15 PM","required":true,"place":"Millikan Courtyard","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Group Photo","sname":"photo","types":["misc"],"timeStart":"2:15 PM","timeEnd":"2:30 PM","required":true,"place":"Millikan Courtyard","shortDesc":""},{"name":"<span>Panel Option A: </span><span>Equity and Inclusion in STEM</span>","sname":"panela","types":["panel"],"timeStart":"2:30 PM","timeEnd":"3:15 PM","required":true,"place":"Smith Campus Center/Millikan Hall","shortDesc":""},{"name":"<span>Panel Option B: </span><span>Balancing Career/&#8203;Life</span>","sname":"panelb","types":["panel"],"timeStart":"2:30 PM","timeEnd":"3:15 PM","required":true,"place":"Smith Campus Center/Millikan Hall","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Coffee Break","sname":"coffee","types":["food","free"],"timeStart":"3:15 PM","timeEnd":"3:45 PM","required":true,"place":"TBD","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Breakout Session 2 of 3","sname":"breakout2","types":["breakout"],"timeStart":"3:45 PM","timeEnd":"4:30 PM","required":true,"place":"Smith Campus Center/Millikan Hall","options":true,"shortDesc":""},{"name":"Coffee Break","sname":"coffee","types":["food","free"],"timeStart":"4:30 PM","timeEnd":"5:00 PM","required":true,"place":"TBD","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Breakout Session 3 of 3","sname":"breakout3","types":["breakout"],"timeStart":"5:00 PM","timeEnd":"5:45 PM","place":"Smith Campus Center/Millikan Hall","required":true,"options":true,"shortDesc":""},{"name":"Dinner","sname":"dinner","types":["food"],"timeStart":"6:00 PM","timeEnd":"7:30 PM","required":true,"place":"Edmunds Ballroom","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Free Time","sname":"free","types":["free"],"timeStart":"7:30 PM","timeEnd":"12:00 AM","required":false,"place":"DoubleTree/Claremont","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Planetarium Shows","sname":"planetarium","types":["free"],"timeStart":"7:30 PM","timeEnd":"9:00 PM","required":false,"place":"Millikan Hall","meetingPlace":"TBD","optionCount":2,"options":[1,2],"shortDesc":""},{"name":"Village Walk","sname":"village","types":["free"],"timeStart":"7:30 PM","timeEnd":"10:00 PM","required":false,"place":"Claremont","meetingPlace":"TBD","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Game Night","sname":"games","types":["free"],"timeStart":"7:30 PM","timeEnd":"10:00 PM","required":false,"place":"Millikan Hall","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Shuttle Runs","sname":"shuttle","types":["shuttle"],"timeStart":"10:00 PM","timeEnd":"10:30 PM","place":"Millikan Hall","required":true,"meetingPlace":"TBD","shortDesc":""}]},{"day":"sunday","college":"Cal Poly Pomona","scollege":"Cal Poly Pomona","events":[{"name":"Breakfast","sname":"breakfast","types":["food"],"timeStart":"7:00 AM","timeEnd":"8:00 AM","required":false,"place":"DoubleTree Hotel","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Shuttle Runs","sname":"shuttle","types":["shuttle"],"timeStart":"8:00 AM","timeEnd":"8:45 AM","required":true,"place":"DoubleTree Hotel","meetingPlace":"TBD","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Futures in Physics Panel","sname":"panel2","types":["panel"],"timeStart":"9:00 AM","timeEnd":"9:50 AM","required":true,"place":"Ursa Minor","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Career Fair/Breakout Sessions","sname":"careerfair","types":["breakout","misc"],"timeStart":"10:00 AM","timeEnd":"12:00 PM","required":true,"options":true,"place":"Ursa Major","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Lunch","sname":"lunch","types":["food"],"timeStart":"12:00 PM","timeEnd":"1:00 PM","required":true,"place":"TBD","shortDesc":""},{"name":"Invited Plenary Talk","sname":"talk2","types":["talk"],"timeStart":"1:00 PM","timeEnd":"2:00 PM","required":true,"place":"Business Building","speaker":"<span>Hilke</span><span>Schlichting</span>","speakerPage":{"type":"faculty profile","URL":"http://epss.ucla.edu/people/faculty/833/"},"speakerImg":"hilke-schlichting.jpg","speakerHome":"UCLA","shortDesc":"<p>Professor Schlichting is a theorist and observer in planetary astrophysics who works primarily on understanding planetary origins.
