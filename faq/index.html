				<h1>About</h1>
				<h3>What is CUWiP?</h3>
				<p>The <a href='https://www.aps.org/'>American Physical Society (APS)</a> Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day regional conferences held simultaneously throughout the United States and Canada for undergraduate women and underrepresented genders interested in physics and astronomy. The 2018 conferences, which will be held from <strong>Friday, January 12 to Sunday, January 14, 2018</strong>, will include talks, panel discussions, workshops, and discussions about important issues and questions in physics.</p>
				<p>The goal of APS CUWiP is to help undergraduate women an dunderrepresented genders continue in physics by providing them with the opportunity to experience a professional conference through which to explore opportunities in graduate schools, careers, research, and community-building in physics. CUWiP is a unique networking opportunity for students to share meaningful experiences and have important conversations about the space we navigate as physicists.	</p>

				<h3>Who is invited to attend CUWiP?</h3>

				<p>
					Any undergraduate student with an interest in physics may apply to attend a CUWiP. For the last decade, Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) has helped undergraduate women thrive in physics by providing them with a unique opportunity to engage with and learn from other women in physics at all stages of their physics careers. At CUWiP, budding physicists will experience a professional conference, learn about graduate school and professions in physics, and share invaluable experiences, advice, and ideas with other underrepresented students. See the next section for more information on <a href='#whocanapply'>who can apply</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>How do you pronounce CUWiP?</h3>

				<p>
					Most people say "Cue-Wip".
				</p>

				<h3>How big is CUWiP?</h3>
				<p>
					2018 marks the 12th year of APS CUWiP. This coming January, 12 different sites across the US and Canada will host regional conferences for undergraduate women in physics. Most sites will host between 100 and 200 participants. The Western Regional CUWiP at Harvey Mudd, Pomona, and Cal Poly Pomona anticipates 150 to 200 attendees.

				<h1>How to Apply</h1>
				<h3>Are "application" and "registration" the same thing?</h3>
				<p>No. You <strong>apply</strong> to attend a CUWiP conference (the one closest to you), and you are accepted, wait-listed or declined according to the priorities listed above. Application is free, and the deadline is Friday, October 13, 2017 at midnight ET. After you have been accepted, you then you <strong>register</strong> to attend the conference to which you have been accepted (you may be assigned to a different conference depending on the number of applications) to confirm that you will actually be attending. There is a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals.</p>

				<h3>How do I know which CUWiP regional site to apply to?</h3>
				<p>You should apply for the CUWiP conference closest to your geographic location during the month of January. If you are uncertain which location this is, please see the map below.</p>

				</p>

				<h3>Do I need to book my travel before registering?</h3>
				<p>No, unless you are traveling by air and your travel cost is not covered by your department, in which case <strong>your airfare must be approved by the conference organizers before you book your travel</strong>. Due to the limited nature of our travel funds, we ask that you find the most economical means of transportation to and from the conference. For example, reach out to others in your department and see if carpooling is an option.</p>

				<h3>When will I know if my application is accepted?</h3>
				<p>We will review applications and inform applicants individually of their status on November 6th. Waitlisted applicants will be notified of their status by November 20th.</p>

				<h1>Cost and Funding</h1>
				<h3>How much does the conference cost?</h3>
				<p>Students who are accepted to attend the conference must pay a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals. If you cannot afford the registration fee and your department/college is unable to help, you may request a fee waiver by submitting a statement attesting to your financial need and verifying that department or university funds are not available. Further details will be provided when you are invited to register for the conference. Please be sure to request a fee waiver at least two days in advance of registering.</p>
				<p>Lodging and food will be covered by the conference; you do not need to pay for your hotel room or food at the conference. We expect that your travel expenses will be covered by your home department or college. However, if they are not able to cover these expenses, limited travel funding will be available. Please <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> as soon as possible in the event that you need to request reimbursement for travel to or from CUWiP.</p>

				<h3>How do I ask my institution for funding?</h3>
				<p>We ask applicants to talk to their department chair, manager, or director of undergraduate studies about funding before registering for CUWiP. You might also ask an academic advisor, faculty member, or other mentor for guidance about who to ask if you are unsure. You will have more success with requesting funds if you are able to organize yourself with others from your department or school who are also attending CUWiP 2018.</p>
				<p>Below is a template you may use when contacting your home institution. Included in the template is a request to cover the $45 registration fee. The template also speaks collectively for other students from your institution who plan on attending. Please adapt the template as necessary. You can also <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> if you are experiencing trouble asking your institution for funds.</p>
				<span class='template'>
					<p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>
					<p>The Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) is a series of regional conferences organized by the American Physical Society that take place at sites across the United States and Canada. The goal of CUWiP is to provide a professional conference for undergraduate women and underrepresented genders to explore opportunities in graduate schools, careers, research, and community-building in physics. This year the western regional conference will be held at Harvey Mudd, Pomona, and Cal Poly Pomona in January 2018.</p>
					<p>The cost of food, lodging, and conference proceedings is covered by CUWiP. However, the conference requests that the home instituion of attendees cover travel costs. In addition, there is a $45 registration fee that either the student attendee or home institution covers that offsets some of the costs of lodging and meals.</p>
					<p>The funds we are requesting depend on the total number of students attending the conference from our institution, which we estimate to be between [insert number of student estimate]. Assuming travel costs of $[insert dollar estimate] per student, we ask the Department to fund a travel grant of $[insert total cost estimate]. In addition, registration fees amount to $[total registration costs]. We therefore ask the department to fund a total grant of $[total travel costs + total registration costs]. The final cost will be determined when the number of students attending from our university is known.</p>
					<p>The deadline for students to apply is October 13th. Students will be notified of their acceptance to CUWiP on November 6th. If at all possible, please let us know your decision before these dated.</p>
					<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>[your name, along with any other students from your institution]</p>
				</span>

				<h3>How do I request travel reimbursement from CUWiP? When will I get reimbursed?</h3>
				<p>If your home institution is unable to cover the funds necessary for you to travel to or from the conference, limited additional travel grants are available. Please <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> as soon as possible. If you are approved for travel funding, please keep track of your travel expenses. The travel reimbursement form will become available after the conference. Reimbursement will be mailed to you within the month.</p>
