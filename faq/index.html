				<h1>About</h1>
				<h3>What is CUWiP?</h3>
				<p>The <a href='https://www.aps.org/'>American Physical Society (APS)</a> Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) are three-day regional conferences held simultaneously throughout the United States and Canada for undergraduate women and underrepresented genders interested in physics and astronomy. The 2018 conferences, which will be held from <strong>Friday, January 12 to Sunday, January 14, 2018</strong>, will include talks, panel discussions, workshops, and discussions about important issues and questions in physics.</p>
				<p>The goal of APS CUWiP is to provide a professional conference for undergraduate women and underrepresented genders to explore opportunities in graduate schools, careers, research, and community-building in physics. CUWiP is a unique networking opportunity for students to share meaningful experiences and have important conversations about the space we navigate as physicists.	</p>

				<h3>How big is CUWiP 2018?</h3>
				<p>
					2018 marks the 12th year of APS CUWiP. This coming January, 12 different sites across the US and Canada will host regional conferences for undergraduate women in physics. Most sites will host between <!--TODO-->100 and 200 participants. The Western Regional CUWiP at Harvey Mudd, Pomona, and Cal Poly Pomona anticipates <!--TODO-->150 to 200 attendees.

			<div class='whocanapply text block'>
				<h1>Who Can Apply</h1>
				<h3>Who can attend? Do I need to be a physics major to apply?</h3>
				<p>Any undergraduate student attending a US college/university may apply. Furthermore, you do not need to be a physics major to apply, so long as you express a sufficient interest in the conference content. However, in the event that the conference is oversubscribed, priority will be given to applicants who are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Undergraduate physics majors</li>
					<li>Community college students planning to transfer to a physics program at a four year institution</li>
					<li>New to conferences, and specifically APS CUWiP</li>
					<li>Applying to the conference that is geographically closest to their expected location January 12th to 14th</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Do I need to have research to present in order to attend the conference?</h3>
				<p>No. While we encourage you to present a talk or a poster if you have been involved in research, you are welcome just to attend the conference and participate in the activities.</p>

				<h3>I attended last year; can I come to this year’s conference, too?</h3>
				<p>The content of this year’s conference will not be exactly the same as last year’s, and you are welcome to apply to attend again. However, if more students apply than we can accommodate, preference will be given to students who have never attended a CUWiP.</p>

				<h3>I'm a student from Canada or a country other than the United States. Can I apply to this CUWiP?</h3>
				<p>Students from Canada are encouraged to apply to the Canadian site at <!--TODO--><a href=''>Queens University</a>. We welcome students attending non-US or non-Canadian institutions to <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> or <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/women/workshops/cuwip.cfm">another CUWiP site</a> to ask if you can apply. CUWiP sites will not be able to reimburse students attending non-US institutions for travel expenses from the conference or for waiver of the registration fee.</p>

				<h3>I'm a high school student, graduate student, postdoc, or faculty member. Am I eligible to apply to CUWiP?</h3>
				<p>Only undergraduate students who will be over 18 at the time of the conference may apply to CUWiP. <!--TODO-->&lt;Site should insert what other interested attendees should do, since it's up to sites to decide how to handle non-undergrads. Usually it's best to accommodate mentors who are traveling with students, but there is no obligation to accommodate others.&gt;</p>

				<h3>I am transgender, gender-fluid, genderqueer, non-binary, and/or do not identify as a woman. Can I still attend this conference?</h3>
				<p>Yes, students of all genders are welcome to attend this conference, and participants are expected treat one another with respect and common courtesy. If you have questions or concerns about housing or any other part of the conference, please <a href='../contact'>contact us</a>.</p>

			<div class='howtoapply text block'>
				<h1>How to Apply</h1>
				<h3>Are "application" and "registration" the same thing?</h3>
				<p>No. You <strong>apply</strong> to attend a CUWiP conference (the one closest to you), and you are accepted, wait-listed, or declined according to the priorities listed above. Application is free, and the deadline is Friday, October 13, 2017 at midnight ET. After you have been accepted, you will receive instructions to <strong>register</strong> with the conference to which you have been accepted (you may be assigned to a different conference depending on the number of applications) to confirm that you will actually be attending.</p>

				<h3>How do I know which CUWiP regional site to apply to?</h3>
				<p>You should apply for the CUWiP conference closest to your geographic location during the month of January. If you are uncertain which location this is, please see the map below.</p>

				</p>

				<h3>Do I need to book my travel before registering?</h3>
				<p>No, unless you are traveling by air and your travel cost is not covered by your department, in which case <strong>your airfare must be approved by the conference organizers before you book your travel</strong>. Due to the limited nature of our travel funds, we ask that you find the most economical means of transportation to and from the conference. For example, reach out to others in your department and see if carpooling is an option.</p>

				<h3>When will I know if my application is accepted?</h3>
				<p>We will review applications and inform applicants individually of their status on November 6th. Waitlisted applicants will be notified of their status by November 20th.</p>

			<div class='costandfunding text block'>
				<h1>Cost and Funding</h1>
				<h3>How much does the conference cost?</h3>
				<p>Students who are accepted to attend the conference must pay a one-time registration fee of $45, which helps offset some of the cost of the conference, including all lodging and meals. If you cannot afford the registration fee and your department/college is unable to help, you may request a fee waiver by submitting a statement attesting to your financial need and verifying that department or university funds are not available. Further details will be provided when you are invited to register for the conference. Please be sure to request a fee waiver at least two days in advance of registering.</p>
				<p>Lodging and food will be covered by the conference; you do not need to pay for your hotel room or food at the conference. We expect that your travel expenses will be covered by your home department or college. However, if they are not able to cover these expenses, travel funding is available <!--TODO-->&lt;sites should specify where to find details about travel funding&gt;</p>

				<h3>How do I ask my institution for funding?</h3>
				<p>We ask applicants to talk to their department chair, manager, or director of undergraduate studies about funding before registering for CUWiP. You might also ask an academic advisor, faculty member, or other mentor for guidance about who to ask if you are unsure. You will have more success with requesting funds if you are able to organize yourself with others from your department or school who are also attending CUWiP 2018.</p>
				<p>Below is a template you may use when contacting your home institution. Included in the template is a request to cover the $45 registration fee. The template also speaks collectively for other students from your institution who plan on attending. Please adapt the template as necessary. You can also <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> if you are experiencing trouble asking your institution for funds.</p>
				<span class='template'>
					<p>To Whom it May Concern,</p>
					<p>The Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics (CUWiP) is a series of regional conferences organized by the American Physical Society that take place at sites across the United States and Canada. The goal of CUWiP is to provide a professional conference for undergraduate women and underrepresented genders to explore opportunities in graduate schools, careers, research, and community-building in physics. This year the western regional conference will be held at Harvey Mudd, Pomona, and Cal Poly Pomona in January 2018.</p>
					<p>The cost of food, lodging, and conference proceedings is covered by CUWiP. However, the conference requests that the home instituion of attendees cover travel costs. In addition, there is a $45 registration fee that either the student attendee or home institution covers that offsets some of the costs of lodging and meals.</p>
					<p>The funds we are requesting depend on the total number of students attending the conference from our institution, which we estimate to be between [insert number of student estimate]. Assuming travel costs of $[insert dollar estimate] per student, we ask the Department to fund a travel grant of $[insert total cost estimate]. In addition, registration fees amount to $[total registration costs]. We therefore ask the department to fund a total grant of $[total travel costs + total registration costs]. The final cost will be determined when the number of students attending from our university is known.</p>
					<p>The deadline for students to apply is October 13th. Students will be notified of their acceptance to CUWiP on November 6th. If at all possible, please let us know your decision before these dated.</p>
					<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
					<p>Sincerely,</p>
					<p>[your name, along with any other students from your institution]</p>

				<h3>How do I request travel reimbursement from CUWiP? When will I get reimbursed?</h3>
				<p>If your home institution is unable to cover the funds necessary for you to travel to or from the conference, limited additional travel grants are available. Please <a href='../contact'>contact us</a> as soon as possible. If you are approved for travel funding, please keep track of your travel expenses. The travel reimbursement form will become available after the conference. Reimbursement will be mailed to you within the month.</p>
